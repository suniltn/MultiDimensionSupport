                       Instructions for Generating new Dimension to Support multiple screen sizes


Background:
-----------

X project has a folder dimens_tools. Inside  this folder there is a Java Application file  DimenConverterTool.java. This is a independent java application with a main method. Use this class to generate the dimes automatically.


Step 1: Compile if need DimenCoverter.class doesn't exist or you need recompile it
----------------

Navigate to the folder PROJECT_HOME/dimens_tools. You can locate DimenConverterTool.java file here.
Compile the java Class if you donâ€™t have it here using command below:

 > javac DimenConverterTool.java

(You have to compile it only once as a setup process)

Step 2: Run
------------
Execute command : > java DimenConverterTool


After execution of the above command the tool deletes the old dimensions.xml in all the values folder and recreates the new files based on the base file.

For the X project the Base file is: /app/src/main/res/values-sw1200dp/dimens.xml

The values mentioned in UI Spec is based on screen size 1200 dp. So all those values goes into the base file : values-sw1200dp/dimens.xml

When you run the tool it picks the values from the base file converts the values in below 3 formats:

/app/src/main/res/values-sw768dp/dimens.xml. (64% of the value in 1200dp screen )
/app/src/main/res/values-sw900dp/dimens.xml  (75% of the value in 1200dp screen)
/app/src/main/res/values-sw411dp/dimens.xml.  (34% of the value in 1200dp screen)

/app/src/main/res/values/dimens.xml (Default is 411dp, i.e. 34% of 1200dp value)


Extension for more screen sizes:
----------------------------------

If you want to support for more screen sizes then you have to add to  DimenConverterTool.java as shown in the example below:

Lets say now we have to support for a new screen size : 20%  (tiny screen) add the below code  as mentioned in the Markers# in code:

MARKER #1.  private static final Double val_0_20 = new Double(0.20);

MARKER #2.   ArrayList<String> list_0_20 = new ArrayList();

MARKER #3.  list_0_20.add("<resources>");

MARKER # 4. map.put(val_0_20, list_0_20);

MARKER #5.  fileNameMap.put(val_0_20, "../app/src/main/res/values-sw768dp/dimens.xml");

MARKER #6. In method convertToNewDimens(..) add the new case 
     else if (factor.doubleValue() == 0.20) {
            save(fileNameMap.get(val_0_20), resultList);
}


Change the Default dimes (values/dimens.xml):
--------------------------------------------

Modify the code accordingly around the comment  //# DEFAULT MARKER
